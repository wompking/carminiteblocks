## Crafting Basics

To start out, you'll want to craft a **dropper**;  this serves as the custom crafter for the Carminite Blocks datapack. Standing on top of the dropper and sneaking *(figure 1)* will craft the contents. The item crafted pops into existence a block above your head, so you can additionally put a hopper there *(figure 2)* to automate the process.

## Basic Crafting Recipes

The first thing you'll want to craft with your newfound power is **Carminite**; its crafting recipe requires iron, redstone, blaze powder, and netherbrick, and is a shapeless recipe. *(figure 3)* The second thing you'll want to make are **Towerwood Planks** and **Encased Towerwood Planks**. Their crafting recipes require iron and any kind of planks. *(figures 4 and 5)*. If you find you have too much carminite on your hands, compact it into **Carminite Blocks**. *(figure 6)* Carminite and carminite blocks can be found inside ruined portal chests. *(figure ADD LATER)*

## Encased Smoker / Fire Jet

The first functional block added by the Carminite Blocks datapack is the **Encased Smoker**. *(figure 7)* When supplied with a redstone input, it opens over the course of three seconds, and then begins emitting blinding smoke. *(figure 8)* When placed, the smoker requires one block of empty air space above it to function; if this space is available, the smoker will then prevent blocks from being placed inside this space. The **Encased Fire Jet** *(figure 8)* works similarly, but instead produces a column of flame instead of smoke. *(figure 9)*
