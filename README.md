## Crafting Basics

To start out, you'll want to craft a **dropper**;  this serves as the custom crafter for the Carminite Blocks datapack. Standing on top of the dropper and sneaking *(figure 1)* will craft the contents. The item crafted pops into existence a block above your head, so you can additionally put a hopper there *(figure 2)* to automate the process.

## Basic Crafting Recipes

The first thing you'll want to craft with your newfound power is **Carminite**; its crafting recipe requires iron, redstone, blaze powder, and netherbrick, and is a shapeless recipe. *(figure 3)* The second thing you'll want to make are **Towerwood Planks** and **Encased Towerwood Planks**. Their crafting recipes require iron and any kind of planks. *(figures 4 and 5)*. If you find you have too much carminite on your hands, compact it into **Carminite Blocks**. *(figure 6)*
